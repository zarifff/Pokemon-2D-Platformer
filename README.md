# Pokemon-2D-Platformer
Project for CSE 215 - Java OOP. Making a 2D Platformer using Slick2D and tutorials

This was intended to be a project for a CSE OOP class. The game was inspired from some online tutorials
using the Slick2D library.

The arts, spritesheets, assets and music are all taken from various online sources and do not belong to me at all.

All Pokemon characters belong to Nintendo and Game Freak and their partners.

This was a project not aimed at profit, but rather a personal endevour with a group member of mine, Taufiq.

I have learnt a lot afterwards, but this was very fun to do while I was still learning the ropes!
